# Notebooks - Insight Project 

**Notebooks 1-8** represent most of the project (I haven't posted everything here). They're mostly to get an idea of the kind of workflow
I used to solve a complex, messy problem. Lots of feature searching, cleaning followed by modeling and model optimization.

1. Initial peak at the data. Understanding the form columns take.
2. Data inspection cleaning, plotting.
3. Feature inspection round 1
4. Focus on Office-based visits (features)
5. Feature selection, again. Adding in a bunch of new features.  
6. Categorization model - Random forest classifier 
7. Regression model - Gradient boosted regression tree  
8. Both categorization and regression models. In basically their final form. 


**Other notebooks contain some pre-project things I tried.**
- Reddit data - played with PRAW API wrapper to see if I could load comment data. Possibly side project.  
- Healthcare dataset exploration - found dataset containing insurance plan information broken down by county. just having a bit of fun.
